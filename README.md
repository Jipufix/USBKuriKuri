Inspired by a cult-favorite anime character, this USB-rechargeable winding key magnetically attaches to any metal surface to bring a bit of nostalgic joy to your everyday life.

The design takes cues from the excellent [Anything Device](https://nandemo-zenmai.com/) by NEKOPLA, a Japan-only product that's hard to find outside of proxy services. USBKuriKuri is an open-source reinterpretation with added features like rechargeable power and smart activation.
